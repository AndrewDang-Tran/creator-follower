      Creator Follower provides RSS feeds for following a creator's content without having to create an account or login. Currently the project supports searching for anime
      creators where the feed items are productions they are affiliated with. It's an open source project with the code hosted
      on <a href="https://github.com/AndrewDang-Tran/creator-follower">github</a>. The project is not affiliated with any of the data sources and is just an extension of
      functionality to be alerted to new works.
